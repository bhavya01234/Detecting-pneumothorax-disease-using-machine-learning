# Detecting-pneumothorax-disease-using-machine-learning
Detecting pneumothorax disease from x-ray scans and predicting where the disease is present using machine learning.

Pneumothorax disease is a collapsed lung where the air escapes into the space between your lung and chest wall. More severe disease can be life threatening whereas less severe might heal itself.

This project is an an app where a person can upload the image of his/her X-ray scan and see whether he/she has the disease. The model also predicts the severity of the disease and whether he or she must consult the doctor.

This project will be built by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and other image processing techniques.
