# Detecting-pneumothorax-disease-using-machine-learning
A pneumothorax (noo-moe-THOR-aks) is a collapsed lung. A pneumothorax occurs when air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall. 
This air pushes on the outside of your lung and makes it collapse.

A user friendly application is built in Flutter to predict patients having Pneumothorax by training the x-ray scans on a machine learning model.

Model used for training: Support Vector Machine(SVM)
Algorithm for feature reduction: Principal Component Analysis

Language used for application: Dart in Flutter

This app takes user input of his/her x-ray scan and displays the message whether he/she has the disease or not.

Current accuracy of model: 72%
